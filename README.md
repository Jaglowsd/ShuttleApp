# ShuttleApp

ShuttleApp is an Android based application built with Android Studios. The objective of the application is to streamline the process of Lawrence University students locating the shopping shuttle.

The Lawrence University shopping shuttle currently works as follows:

	a. Students manually find schedules of the shopping shuttle on the Lawrence University website.
		
	b. They arrive to the location where the shuttle drops students off and picks up new students and must wait, hoping that the shuttle is on schedule.	

	c. Once the shuttle arrives, students write their name and phone number on a sheet of paper so that the shuttle driver knows the students they currently have.
	
	d. The shuttle will stop at a location, allow the students that want to exit, and continue following their route.  
	
	e. The students are only given an estimate of how long it will take the driver to return to their stop, so they must be careful to not miss the shuttle.
	
	f. On the very final iteration of the driver’s route, they will call all students still off campus when they reach each stop for the final time ensuring no one is left behind.
  
ShuttleApp proposes the following improvements:
	
	a. Students may download an application on their smart devices to track the exact location of the shuttle.
	
	b. They are given an ETA to the stop of their choosing. So, they may arrive exactly as the shuttle driver is arriving.
	
	c. The student boarding the shuttle will sign-in with a digital clipboard that the driver has with their name and phone number.
	
	d. Students exiting the shuttle no longer have an ETA for the shuttle, they will simply look on their device and be given real-time ETAs incorporating traffic in addition to alerts the shuttle driver may send out in case of unforeseen circumstances.
	
	e. Students will receive notifications on their device’s that the shuttle driver is making their last rounds so the students know when to return to the shuttle.
